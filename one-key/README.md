# Commentary
;; With so many Emacs extensions, you have a lot of keystrokes to remember, and you probably forget most of them.
;; This package fixes this problem.
;; One Key provides a TOP keystroke that when pressed presents you with
a menu of choices in a popup window for commands to execute with a further keystroke.
;; Just type one of the listed keystrokes to execute the corresponding command.
;; You can also associate different menus with different major modes so that the menu presented depends on the
current major mode.
;; * Quick use example:
;; Add the variables and functions below to your ~/.emacs
;; (defvar one-key-menu-emms-alist nil
  "`One-Key' menu list for EMMS.")
;; (setq one-key-menu-emms-alist
      '(
        (("g" . "Playlist Go") . emms-playlist-mode-go)
        (("d" . "Play Directory Tree") . emms-play-directory-tree)
        (("f" . "Play File") . emms-play-file)
        (("i" . "Play Playlist") . emms-play-playlist)
        (("t" . "Add Directory Tree") . emms-add-directory-tree)
        (("c" . "Toggle Repeat Track") . emms-toggle-repeat-track)
        (("w" . "Toggle Repeat Playlist") . emms-toggle-repeat-playlist)
        (("u" . "Play Now") . emms-play-now)
        (("z" . "Show") . emms-show)
        (("s" . "Emms Streams") . emms-streams)
        (("b" . "Emms Browser") . emms-browser)))
;; (defun one-key-menu-emms ()
  "`One-Key' menu for EMMS."
  (interactive)
  (one-key-menu "emms" one-key-menu-emms-alist t))
;; Add an item to `one-key-toplevel-alist' in the customization buffer for one-key
(M-x customize-group RET one-key RET). The first item should be the key (e.g. m), the second item
should be a description (e.g. "Emacs multimedia system"), and the third item should be the command:
`one-key-menu-emms'. Then bind `one-key-menu-toplevel' to any key you want E.g:
;;  (global-set-key (kbd "C-M-s-SPC") 'one-key-menu-toplevel)
;; Alternatively you can ignore the toplevel menu and just bind `one-key-menu-emms' to a key,
E.g:
;;      (global-set-key (kbd "C-c p") 'one-key-menu-emms)
;; Now when you type the key, a one-key menu will popup at the bottom of the window.
Then you just type a keystroke listed in the menu to execute the corresponding command.
;; You can also associate menus with major-modes using the customizable `one-key-mode-alist' variable, 
and the `one-key-get-menu' command. When this command is run it will open the menu associated with the 
current major-mode, or the toplevel menu if there is no associated menu.
You can bind this to a global key, e.g:
;;     (global-set-key (kbd "C-s-SPC") 'one-key-get-menu)
;; Now you don't need to remember so many keystrokes, just remembering one keystroke is enough!
;; ** The format of the menu list:
;; (("KEYSTROKE" . "DESCRIBE") . COMMAND)
;; Example:
;; (defvar example-menu-alist
     '(
       (("Keystroke-A" . "Describe-A") . Command-A)
       (("Keystroke-B" . "Describe-B") . Command-B)
       (("Keystroke-C" . "Describe-C") . Command-C)
       ))
;; Make sure COMMAND is `interactive', otherwise it will throw an error.
;; ** The format of menu function:
;; (one-key-menu "MENU-NAME" MENU-ALIST)
;; Example:
;; (defun example-menu ()
  (interactive)
  (one-key-menu "example" example-menu-alist)
;; ** The arguments of the function `one-key-menu':
;; `title' is the title of menu, any string you like.
`info-alist' is a special list that contains KEY, DESCRIPTION
     and COMMAND.  see above description about `example-menu-alist'.
`miss-match-exit-p' set to t means the popup window will exit when you
     type a KEY that can't match in menu.
`recursion-p' is whether or not recursion will execute `one-key-menu' on self
     when no KEY matchs in the menu.
`protect-function' is a protect function that is called last in `one-key-menu',
     make sure this function is an `interactive' function.
`alternate-function' is an alternate function to execute last.
`execute-last-command-when-miss-match' whether to execute the last input command
when keystroke is not matched.
;; Creating menus for keymaps:
;; You can use `one-key-insert-template' to insert template code for a special keymap,
or `one-key-show-template' to create a special buffer called "One-Key-Template" containing the template code.
For example, after you run `one-key-insert-template', you will get a Keymap prompt:
"Keymap to One-Key: ", in which you enter the name of a keymap or a prefix key with an associated keymap.
After entering the keymap/prefix key you are prompted for a title for the menu, and then code for the menu
will be automatically generated.
E.g. if you type "C-x r", and then enter the title "bookmark" then it will generate template code
like the code shown below:
;; (defvar one-key-menu-bookmark-alist nil
  "The `one-key' menu list for BOOKMARK.")
;; (setq one-key-menu-bookmark-alist
   '(
     (("C-@" . "point-to-register") . point-to-register)
     (("SPC" . "point-to-register") . point-to-register)
     (("+" . "increment-register") . increment-register)
     (("b" . "bookmark-jump") . bookmark-jump)
     (("c" . "clear-rectangle") . clear-rectangle)
     (("d" . "delete-rectangle") . delete-rectangle)
     (("f" . "frame-configuration-to-register") . frame-configuration-to-register)
     (("g" . "insert-register") . insert-register)
     (("i" . "insert-register") . insert-register)
     (("j" . "jump-to-register") . jump-to-register)
     (("k" . "kill-rectangle") . kill-rectangle)
     (("l" . "bookmark-bmenu-list") . bookmark-bmenu-list)
     (("m" . "bookmark-set") . bookmark-set)
     (("n" . "number-to-register") . number-to-register)
     (("o" . "open-rectangle") . open-rectangle)
     (("r" . "copy-rectangle-to-register") . copy-rectangle-to-register)
     (("s" . "copy-to-register") . copy-to-register)
     (("t" . "string-rectangle") . string-rectangle)
     (("w" . "window-configuration-to-register") . window-configuration-to-register)
     (("x" . "copy-to-register") . copy-to-register)
     (("y" . "yank-rectangle") . yank-rectangle)
     (("C-SPC" . "point-to-register") . point-to-register)
     ))
;; (defun one-key-menu-bookmark ()
  (interactive)
  (one-key-menu "BOOKMARK" one-key-menu-bookmark-alist))
;; If you used `one-key-show-template' the code is placed in the special buffer "One-Key-Template"
which has it's own one-key menu and keybindings bound to special helper functions to help you edit the
menu. Type M-x one-key-get-menu to see a menu of commands/keybindings for this buffer
(or use one-key-menu-one-key-template if it is not listed in one-key-mode-alist).
For example you can move items in the menu up/down using "M-<up>" or "M-<down>".
You can sort the items in the currently active region alphabetically by description/key binding/command
by pressing "C-c C-s" followed by d/k/c.
You can quickly test your menu by pressing "C-c C-t".
;; Fixed menu keys:
;; Some keys are available for all menus and are always the same, they can be configured with the following variables:
 `one-key-key-hide'   :  key to hide the menu, default is "?"
 `one-key-key-quit'   :  key to quit the menu, default is "q"
 `one-key-key-up'     :  key to scroll the menu down one line, default is "<up>"
 `one-key-key-down'   :  key to scroll the menu up one line, default is "<down>"
 `one-key-key-pgup'   :  key to scroll the menu down one page, default is "<prior>"
 `one-key-key-pgdown' :  key to scroll the menu up one page, default is "<next>"
 `one-key-key-help'   :  when this key is pressed, the next keypress will show help for the corresponding command,
                         default is "C-?"
 `one-key-key-edit'   :  key to edit the menu (if the source file can be found), default is "C-/"
;; Auto-load one-key menus:
;; If you set `one-key-auto-load-menus' to t (in the customization group for one-key), then any files
in the directory specified by `one-key-menus-location' that match the regexp `one-key-menus-regexp'
will automatically be loaded on startup.

# Installation
;; Put one-key.el in a directory in your load-path, e.g. ~/.emacs.d/
You can add a directory to your load-path with the following line in ~/.emacs
(add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/elisp"))
where ~/elisp is the directory you want to add 
(you don't need to do this for ~/.emacs.d - it's added by default).
;; Add the following to your ~/.emacs startup file.
;; (require 'one-key)
;; Because this library uses a special implementation,
sometimes a `max-lisp-eval-depth' or `max-specpdl-size' error can occur.
;; So making the above two variables larger will reduce the probability that an error occurs.
E.g:
;; (setq max-lisp-eval-depth 10000)
(setq max-specpdl-size 10000)

# Customize
;; `one-key-buffer-name' : the buffer name of the popup menu.
`one-key-help-window-max-height' : the maximal height use in popup window.
`one-key-items-per-line' : number of items in one line, if this option is `nil', will be calculated by `window-width'.
`one-key-keystroke-face' : face for highlighting keystroke
`one-key-auto-load-menus' : if t then automatically load one-key menus from `one-key-menus-location'
`one-key-menus-location' : location in which one-key menus will be stored
`one-key-menus-regexp' : regexp to match filenames of one-key menus
`one-key-mode-alist' : An alist of major-mode, one-key menu pairs to set the default menu for each major-mode.
`one-key-toplevel-alist' : A list of key items for the toplevel menu.
`one-key-popup-window' : whether to popup window when first time run, default is `t'.
`one-key-prompt-face' : face for highlighting prompt
`one-key-template-buffer-name' : the buffer name of the template code.
`one-key-title-face' : face for highlighting title
`one-key-key-hide'   :  key to hide the menu, default is "?"
`one-key-key-quit'   :  key to quit the menu, default is "q"
`one-key-key-up'     :  key to scroll the menu down one line, default is "<up>"
`one-key-key-down'   :  key to scroll the menu up one line, default is "<down>"
`one-key-key-pgup'   :  key to scroll the menu down one page, default is "<prior>"
`one-key-key-pgdown' :  key to scroll the menu up one page, default is "<next>"
`one-key-key-help'   :  when this key is pressed, the next keypress will show help for the corresponding command,
                        default is "C-?"
`one-key-key-edit'   :  key to edit the menu (if the source file can be found), default is "C-/"

All above options can by customized through:
     M-x customize-group RET one-key RET

# TODO
;; Add configurable colourization of menu items.
Could have alist of alists, called e.g. `one-key-colours-regexp-alist',
the keys to the list would be symbols for the one-key menu alists (e.g. 'one-key-menu-bookmark-alist)
and each value would be an alist of regexp/colour pairs.
Then when a menu is formatted, any items matching a regexp in the associated colours-regexp alist
would be coloured with the associated colour. E.g. could make items that are themselves one-key menus
all the same colour, and other items a different colour.
;; Option to automatically split menu when creating templates based on prefix keys.
;; Function to split items matching regexp into seperate menu in when editing menu in `one-key-template-mode'.
;; Automatically generate one-key menus for common keybindings and store them in memory. This is already implemented
to a certain extent but I think it could be improved. Needs further investigation.
