;;; Commentary: 
;; 
;; This library will add a new one-key menu type called "apropos-command".
;; When you add a new menu of this type to a set of one-key menus you will be prompted for a word list or regexp,
;; and new one-key menus will be added containing commands matching those words/regexps.
;;

;;; Installation:
;;
;; Put one-key-apropos.el in a directory in your load-path, e.g. ~/.emacs.d/
;; You can add a directory to your load-path with the following line in ~/.emacs
;; (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/elisp"))
;; where ~/elisp is the directory you want to add 
;; (you don't need to do this for ~/.emacs.d - it's added by default).
;;
;; Add the following to your ~/.emacs startup file.
;;
;; (require 'one-key-apropos)

;;; Customize: `one-key-apropos-special-keybindings' 
;;
;; All of the above can customized by:
;;      M-x customize-group RET one-key-apropos RET
;;
