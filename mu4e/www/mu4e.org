#+title: mu4e: an e-mail client for emacs
#+style: <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="mu.css">
#+options: skip t

  Starting with version 0.9.8, [[http://www.djcbsoftware.nl/code/mu][mu]] provides an emacs-based e-mail client which
  uses =mu= as its back-end: *mu4e*.

  Through =mu=, =mu4e= sits on top of your Maildir (which you update with
  e.g. =offlineimap= or =fetchmail=). =mu4e= is designed to enable
  super-efficient handling of e-mail; searching, reading, replying, moving,
  deleting. The overall 'feel' is a bit of a mix of =dired= and [[http://www.gohome.org/wl/][Wanderlust]].

  Features include:
  - Fully search-based: there are no folders, only queries
  - UI optimized for speed with quick key strokes for common actions
  - Fully documented, with example configurations
  - Asynchronous: heavy actions never block emacs
  - Write rich-text e-mails using ~org-mode~ (experimental)
  - Address auto-completion based on your messages -- no need for managing
    address books
  - Extendable in many places using custom actions

  For all the details, please see the [[file:mu4e/index.html][manual]], or check the screenshots
  below. ~mu4e~ is part of the normal [[http://code.google.com/p/mu0/downloads/list][mu source package]] and also [[https://github.com/djcb/mu][available on
  Github]].
